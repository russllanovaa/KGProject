The Regular Pentagon â€” The Fancy Diva of Shapes
Equally spaced points, sharp edges, and a lot of drama.
The angle between vertices is:
angleStep = 2 * PI / 5;
Each vertex is calculated just like for the circle:
x = x0 + cos(angle) * radius;
y = y0 + sin(angle) * radius;
Happy drawing, brave shape-summoner. May your angles be accurate and your code be bug-free (ha, wishful thinking).
