Salem;Tara, the time has come. You have mastered the basics - lines, shapes, colours. But the true art of magic is not only knowledge, but understanding. The castle is waiting.;0;left
Tara;The Castle of Light... I've read about it in old scrolls. Do they teach real magic there;0;right
Salem;Yes, there you will learn the essence of shapes and movement, the secrets of fractals and the power of colour. But our path will not be easy, we will have to go through the forests of Illusions, the mountains of Symmetry.;0;left
Tara;And each of the trials can be overcome only by... knowledge?;1;right
Salem;That's right, my student. Magic is not magic. It is logic, observation and understanding of visual harmony.;0;left
