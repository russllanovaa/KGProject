The Circle — Geometry’s Drama Queen 
It’s centered at C = (x0, y0) and has a radius r. 
To summon it, use these ancient formulas: 
x = x0 + r * cos(angle);   
y = y0 + r * sin(angle); 
To actually draw the circle (because one point won’t cut it), you’ll calculate these coordinates for many angles between 0 and 2π. Like, a lot of them.
