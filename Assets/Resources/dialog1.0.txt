Tara;Oh no. We’ve barely made it a tenth of the way, and there’s already a massive stone wall in our path. What kind of forest is this?;0;right
Salem;Meow, meow.;0;left
Tara;You’re right, there’s a giant keyhole here — no way we’re finding a key that size... Wait a second, Salem, look! The lock is changing shape! What kind of gate does that?;0;right
Salem;Meow.;0;left
Tara;You think a “Побудова двовимірних зображень” spell might work here? Who even names these spells? Fine, it’s a simple one — perfect for warming up my wand a bit.;2;right
Salem;Meeooow.;0;left
Tara;Yep, you’re right — the lock cycles through three shapes: a circle, then a square, then a pentagon. Good thing they all have the same radius. Alright, time to do some magic!;1;right
