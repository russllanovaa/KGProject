The Inscribed Square — The Circle’s Introverted Friend

Its corners gently touch the circle, and it’s aligned with the coordinate axes like a good citizen.
The side of this square is calculated as:
side = radius * SQRT(2);
Its corners lie at 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315° angles from the center (aka 90° apart because symmetry is fashionable).
